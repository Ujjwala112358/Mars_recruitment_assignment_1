project2: Attempt at Rover navigation system- The rover can only move in forward direction. If object appears in front, rover stops and judges whether it should move left or right and starts to move again. Servo motor acts like the axel of the wheels, turning 90 degrees right or left depending on the situation. D.C motor is attached to wheel. If rover cannot move forward, right, or left, buzzer is sounded.If rover is turning right, right LED will glow, if it is turning left, left LED will glow. However, this code has problem so it is not working.
